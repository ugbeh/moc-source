                From Storytelling to Seeds of Change: The Mothers of Chibok
                Legacy
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-5">
                For me, filmmaking is not just about telling stories; it’s about
                using those stories to empower and uplift communities in
                tangible ways. I want my stories to serve as a catalyst for
                action, something that drives people to contribute to meaningful
                change.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-5">
                In 2019, when I made Mothers of Chibok, the most significant
                takeaway for me was the opportunity to make a real difference in
                the lives of the women in Chibok. We were able to provide over
                120 women with solar-powered home systems, donate sewing
                machines, and offer financial support for farming equipment.In
                2021, I returned to Chibok, and over nearly three years of
                making this new film, I watched the women tirelessly plant and
                harvest peanuts, season after season. Yet their hard work was
                often diminished by middlemen who undercut their profits,
                leaving them with barely enough to sustain their families. For
                years, their livelihoods had been undervalued, dictated by
                others who benefited from their labour. But what if we could
                change this dynamic? What if we could place the power directly
                in their hands, bypassing the middlemen altogether?
                <br />
                This is how the Chibok Peanut Initiative (CPI) was born. The
                specific goal of the initiative is to create a sustainable,
                community-driven peanut farming and marketing system that
                ensures the women keep the majority of the profits from their
                labour. With greater financial independence, they can send their
                children to school, invest in their futures, and break the cycle
                of poverty.
                <br />
                In our current pilot phase, the initiative supported nine
                dedicated women farmers in Chibok with access to improved seed
                varieties, fertilizers, herbicides, mechanized tools, and
                technical training from Agric experts at a local university.
                During our baseline surveys, our results showed that in 2024,
                with 465.2 kg of seeds planted across 8.56 hectares, the women
                harvested 88 bags of groundnut. After inputs and training, our
                2025 mid-season assessment indicates that, even with a reduced
                seed volume of 342.4 kg, the women’s total harvest are projected
                to yield 214 bags—an increase of over 140%.

              <p className="mb-5">
                The pilot’s success has shown us what’s possible. With the
                harvest season approaching, immediate priorities include
                pre-harvest training, securing storage facilities, and acquiring
                equipment to protect quality, and prepare the peanuts for sale.
                A reliable off-taker is already in place to purchase directly
                from the women at fair market prices, bypassing exploitative
                middlemen.
