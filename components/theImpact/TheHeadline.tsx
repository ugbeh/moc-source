            When the headlines faded, the mothers of Chibok were only left with
            their memories, their fields, and a resolute belief in the power of
            education. For them, sending their children to school is more than a
            goal. It is an act of quiet defiance. Farming is the means through
            which they make it possible. We are building on that resilience, to
            turn the stories from the film into tangible change. This is how the
            Chibok Peanut Initiative was born, with a specific goal to create a
            sustainable, community-driven peanut farming and marketing system
            that ensures the women keep the majority of the profits from their
            labour. With greater financial independence, they can send their
            children to school, invest in their futures, and break the cycle of
            poverty.

            In our current pilot phase, the initiative is supporting nine
            dedicated women farmers in Chibok with access to improved seed
            varieties, fertilizers, herbicides, mechanized tools, and technical
            training from Agric experts.

            During our baseline surveys, our results showed that in the previous
            season, with 465.2 kg of seeds planted across 8.56 hectares, the
            women harvested 88 bags of groundnut. After inputs and training, our
            2025 mid-season assessment indicates that, even with a reduced seed
            volume of 342.4 kg, the women's total harvest is projected to yield
            214 bags, which is an increase of over 140%. The pilot's success has
            shown us what's possible. With the harvest season approaching,
            immediate priorities include pre-harvest training, securing storage
            facilities, and acquiring equipment to protect quality, and prepare
            the peanuts for sale. A reliable off-taker is already in place to
            purchase directly from the women at fair market prices, bypassing
            exploitative middlemen.
